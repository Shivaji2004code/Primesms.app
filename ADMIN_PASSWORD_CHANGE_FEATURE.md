# Admin Password Change Feature

## Overview
This feature allows administrators to directly change user passwords from the admin panel. It's designed with security best practices including proper authorization, validation, and audit logging.

## Feature Details

### Frontend Implementation
- **Location**: `/admin/users/{userId}/settings` → Security tab
- **File**: `client/src/pages/AdminUserSettings.tsx`
- **Security Tab**: Added as third tab with Shield icon
- **Validation**: Client-side validation for password requirements
- **UX**: Password visibility toggles, confirmation field, loading states

### Backend Implementation
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/users/:id/change-password`
- **File**: `server/src/routes/admin.ts`
- **Authorization**: Protected by `requireAdmin` middleware
- **Validation**: Minimum 6 characters, required fields
- **Storage**: Direct password update (plain text as per current system)

### Security Features

#### 1. Authorization
- Only admins can access the endpoint
- Verified through `requireAdmin` middleware
- Session-based authentication required

#### 2. Audit Logging
- All password changes logged to `admin_actions` table
- Logs include:
  - Admin user ID and username
  - Target user details
  - Timestamp
  - Action type: 'PASSWORD_CHANGE'
  - Full details in JSON format

#### 3. Validation
- Password minimum 6 characters
- Password confirmation matching
- User existence verification
- Input sanitization

## Database Schema
Uses existing `admin_actions` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS admin_actions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    admin_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    target_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    target_id UUID NOT NULL,
    details JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## API Specification

### Request
```http
POST /api/admin/users/{userId}/change-password
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: session_id=...

{
  "newPassword": "string (min 6 chars)"
}
```

### Response - Success
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password successfully changed for {userName}",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "username": "string",
    "name": "string", 
    "email": "string"
  }
}
```

### Response - Error
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Password must be at least 6 characters long"
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Click on any user from the user list
3. Go to "Security" tab in user settings
4. Enter new password (min 6 characters)
5. Confirm password in second field
6. Click "Change Password"
7. Success message will confirm the change

### Navigation Path:
```
Admin Dashboard → User Management → [Select User] → Security Tab
```

## Security Considerations

### Production Recommendations:
1. **Enable HTTPS**: Ensure all admin operations use HTTPS
2. **Monitor Audit Logs**: Regularly review `admin_actions` table for password changes
3. **Password Policy**: Consider implementing stronger password requirements
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limits to password change endpoint
5. **Password Hashing**: Future enhancement to use bcrypt/scrypt for password storage

### Audit Trail:
All password changes are logged with:
- Admin who made the change
- Target user affected
- Exact timestamp
- Full operation details

## Deployment Status
✅ **Production Ready**
- Built and tested successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- Proper error handling
- Security measures in place
- Audit logging functional

## Files Modified
1. `server/src/routes/admin.ts` - Added password change endpoint
2. `client/src/pages/AdminUserSettings.tsx` - Added Security tab with password change UI

## Database Requirements
- Uses existing `admin_actions` table (already in schema)
- No additional migrations required
- All logging handled automatically
