# Bulk Messaging Configuration Example
# Add these variables to your existing .env file

# WhatsApp Graph API Configuration
GRAPH_API_VERSION=v22.0

# Bulk Processing Settings
BULK_BATCH_SIZE=50              # Messages per batch (max recommended: 50)
BULK_CONCURRENCY=5              # Concurrent messages within a batch
BULK_PAUSE_MS=1000              # Pause between batches in milliseconds
BULK_MAX_RETRIES=3              # Max retries for failed messages
BULK_RETRY_BASE_MS=500          # Base retry delay in milliseconds
BULK_HARD_CAP=50000             # Maximum total recipients per job

# Rate Limiting Notes:
# - BULK_BATCH_SIZE: Keep at 50 or lower to respect WhatsApp rate limits
# - BULK_CONCURRENCY: 5 is recommended to avoid overwhelming the API
# - BULK_PAUSE_MS: 1000ms (1 second) pause between batches helps avoid rate limits
# - BULK_MAX_RETRIES: 3 retries with exponential backoff for resilience
# - BULK_HARD_CAP: Safety limit to prevent accidental large sends

# Example optimized settings for high-volume production:
# BULK_BATCH_SIZE=50
# BULK_CONCURRENCY=3
# BULK_PAUSE_MS=2000
# BULK_MAX_RETRIES=5
# BULK_RETRY_BASE_MS=1000

# Example settings for development/testing:
# BULK_BATCH_SIZE=10
# BULK_CONCURRENCY=2  
# BULK_PAUSE_MS=500
# BULK_MAX_RETRIES=2
# BULK_HARD_CAP=1000
